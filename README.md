# py-garden
An idle (py)game where a little ecosystem grows and matures as you feed it. Inspired by [VSCode Pets](https://github.com/tonybaloney/vscode-pets)!

Animals will peacefully wander a nature scene grazing, and will seek out bits of food placed in the environment by the user.
The user's stock of food will be replenished over time, and there may be some mechanic in the future where the user will get extra bits of food by making `git commits`, or something of that nature that hopefully won't turn into a silly *"KPI"*-type thing.

More thorough work to be done on this README in the future. If you have any comments or advice about the project, please contact me! :)

Also open to a better name than "py-garden", feel free to make suggestions!

## Running the app

Instructions are currently written according to my Windows 10 machine.

* After you `git clone` the repo, `cd py-garden` to open the project directory
* Run `py -m venv venv` to set up a virtual environment. Start the venv from the command line with `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`.
* Once your venv is running, you'll see `(venv)` in your terminal. 
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies for the project.
* Now you can run the game with the command `py run.py`!

Please see the wiki tab for some more detailed information about the project structure and configuration!
