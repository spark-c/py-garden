# py-garden
An idle (py)game where a little ecosystem grows and matures as you feed it. Inspired by [VSCode Pets](https://github.com/tonybaloney/vscode-pets)!

Animals will peacefully wander a nature scene grazing, and will seek out bits of food placed in the environment by the user.
The user's stock of food will be replenished over time, and there may be some mechanic in the future where the user will get extra bits of food by making `git commits`, or something of that nature that hopefully won't turn into a silly *"KPI"*-type thing.

More thorogh work to be done on this README in the future. If you have any comments or advice about the project, please contact me! :)

Also looking for a better name than "py_garden", feel free to suggest.
